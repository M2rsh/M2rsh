# DMT
How to make DMT in the kitchen
DMT stands for N,N-dimethyltryptamine. DMT is a semisynthetic compound similar to psilocin in structure. (Psilocin is the hallucinogenic substance based in psilocy- bin.) DMT is extremely fast-acting. Within several minutes of ingestion, the effects can be felt, but it doesn't last as Jong as other psychedelics. The intensity, on the other hand, is as strong; for about 30 to 45 minutes you are completely under the influence of this drug. The most common method of ingestion is smoking, but I have heard that there were some capsules around for about two years. Whether they were good or not, I have no idea. Carefully soaked parsley leaves are the usual medium for smoking, although some persons have dipped marihuana in it and said the experience was fantastic. Other compounds sim- ilar to DMT are both DET and DPT.
The next recipe is for DMT. It is very simple and can easily be performed in the kitchen. All the chemicals and equipment are available from any chemical supply house or hobby shop.


Recipe for DMT:
1. Mix thoroughly and dissolve 25 grams of indole with a pound of dry ethyl ether in a 2,000-ml. flask (two-quart jar).
2. Take ice tray and fill with chipped or shaved ice. Now cool solution for about 35 minutes until it reaches the temperature of 0 degrees C. At the same time cool 50 ml. of dry oxalychloride to about 5 degrees below 0 degrees C. in the same ice tray.
3. Very slowly add the oxalychloride solution to the in- dole solution.
Warning: When these two chemicals are mixed together, there is an extremely violent reaction. Avoid boiling over, avoid contact with skin, and avoid fumes.
4. Wait until all the bubbling has died down, then add a few handfuls of common table salt to the ice tray, to cool the solution further. Put this solution aside and label it "solution 1."
5. Cool 100 ml. of dry ethyl ether, in a 500-ml. flask, to 0 degrees C. in a salted ice tray. At the same time cool an unopened 100-gram bottle of dimethylamine to 0 degrees C. in the same ice bath.
6. Open the seal of the dimethylamine bottle and slow- ly pour a steady stream into the ether. Label "solution 2."
7. Very slowly and carefully add solution "1" and "2" together.
8. Now take the mixed solutions from the ice tray and bring up to room temperature, stirring the solution all the time. You should be left with a solution which is almost clear. If it is still murky, continue stirring until it becomes as clear as possible.
9. Now filter the solution to separate the precipitate by suction, as shown in Figure 7.

10. Refilter with suction after pouring technical ether over the precipitate.
11. Repeat filtering once more with ether and then twice with water.
12. Let this substance dry on a plastic or china plate. (Do not use metal.) After drying, a solid material will be formed. Take these particles and place them in a 800-ml. beaker.
13. Mix 100 ml. benzene with 100 ml. methyl alcohol. After the mixture has been stirred, cover solid particles from step 12 with about a half inch of the solution and heat the beaker in water until all solid material has dissolved. Add more solvent if necessary. See Figure 8 below.

14. After all the solid material has dissolved, remove beaker from the heat, and allow it to cool. As it cools, small needle-shaped crystals will appear. When this happens, try to pour off as much of the solvent as possible without dis- turbing the crystals.
15. Place crystals in a 1,000-ml. flask and dissolve in tetrahydrofurane. (Use only as much as absolutely neces- sary.) Label this solution "A."
16. Slowly mix 200 ml. tetrahydrofuranc and 20 grams lithium aluminum hydride in a 500-ml, flask, and label it solution "B."
Warning: Lithium aluminum hydride ignites on contact with moisture. Do not use on humid days. Protect eyes and wear rubber gloves.
17. Mix solutions "A" and "B" slowly, stirring con- stantly.
18. Prepare a water bath and heat solution in water bath for three hours, stirring for four minutes every half hour. When not stirring, use aspirator tube as shown in Figure 9.

19. When this is completed, allow the flask to remain at room temperature for about 20 minutes. Then place in salted ice bath and cool to 0 degrees C. Add a small amount of chilled methanol, stirring gently until solution appears murky.
20. Filter this murky solution through a paper filter in a funnel, and collect the filtered liquid in a flask.
21. Add 100 ml. of tetrahydrofuran through the filter and collect in the same flask. Now heat this solution in a water bath until most of the tetrahydrofuran is evaporated and a gooey substance remains.
22. Place little piles of this substance on a cookie tray and, with a heat lamp, dry for three or four hours. Now you have D.M.T. To ingest, crumble a small quantity with parsley or mint, and smoke. Do not inject. Do not smoke with tobacco. DMT is a powerful psychedelic and should not be abused.
Author's note: All chemicals in the last recipe can be ordered by mail from any of the large chemical manufac- turers. Lithium aluminum hydride may be ordered from Metal Hydrides Inc., Beverly, Massachusetts (it costs about $20 per 100 grams). All other chemicals can be ordered from Van Water-Rogers.
